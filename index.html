    <h1>Games For Windows / Current Seen<br><br>Oct. 4 - Nov. 17, 2019<br><br>128 W. Main St., Rochester, NY</h1>
    <p style="max-width:900px"><br><br><span style="font-size: 20px">
        <em>Games for Windows: Experiments with Game Footage</em> is a store-front window exhibition curated by <a href="https://nilsoncarroll.com" style="font-size:20px; text-decoration:none">Nilson Carroll</a> at The Liquor Store in Rochester, NY. Expanding the tradition of cinema and games, these artists use various gestures of play to create experimental video art from video game footage.<br><br>
        
        Expanding the tradition of cinema and games, these regional and international artists use various gestures of play to create experimental video art from video game footage. These videos work through issues of sexism in popular culture, gun-related violence, modes of queering, mainstream ludic binaries, and intimacy in games by taking radical approaches to the formal qualities of video games. Relieved of their performative, neo-liberal gameplay hierarchies, the game footage and graphics in these videos are imbued with new meanings, difficult questions, and unfamiliar aesthetics. By presenting these works together in an ongoing public viewing space, images and actions familiar to game players constantly shift and create new dialogues between the monitors as well as between games culture, the art world, and the pedestrians of Rochester.<br><br>This exhibition is one of many in the 2019 <a href="hhttp://www.currentseen.org/event/games-for-windows/" style="font-size:20px; text-decoration:none">Current Scene</a> series running October through November.</span><br><br>

Artists include Sandra Ara&ugrave;jo, Jordan Baruch (Long Island), Rob Cigna (Rochester), Heidi E. Cooper (Vietnam), Kasey Edgerton (Rochester), Cody Filardi (Rochester), Emma Goldman (Troy, New York), Kara Gut (Ohio), Thomas Hawranke (Germany), Alex Hovet (New York City), Matthew Keff (Brooklyn), Ryan Keller (Long Island), Eddie Lohmeyer (Orlando, Florida), Robin Mendoza (Albany), Drew Mounce (Long Island), Karl Munstedt (Brooklyn), Tara Nelson (Rochester), Joshua Thorson (Rochester/Brooklyn), and Bloody Noes.

<p>Eddie Lohmeyer is an Assistant Professor of Games and Interactive Media at the University of Central Florida. His research explores aesthetic and technical developments within histories of digital media, with a particular emphasis on video games and their relationship to traditions of the avant-garde. Additionally, his art considers embodied experience through processes of play and defamiliarization. Using deconstructive approaches such as glitch, physical modifications to hardware, assemblage, etc., his installations and experimental video works stage bizarre encounters with nostalgic media as a means to unveil our normal attitudes and perceptions toward technologies.</p>

<p>Emerging new media artist Emma Goldman explores new visual practices through the utilization of projection art and a variety of presentation techniques focusing on memory and recollection. With a background in classical philosophy and media production, Goldman focuses on looking at higher questions, specifically what is making their piece move and what kind of questions viewers might ask themselves. By developing environments that are meant to trigger intense feelings of nostalgia, they hope to open viewers to new perspectives that exist in familiar spaces.
